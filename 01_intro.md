# **Introduction to Chip Design**

**Martin Schoeberl and Luca Pezzarossa**
## TODO

 * Talk about the tools
 * Talk about the output files
   * Details later
 * Got through 4 in Z2A for additional stuff


## Welcome

 * Learn the basics of chip design
 * Design and fabricate your own chip (ASIC)
 * We will use open-source tools only
 * This is a new 13-week course
    * We will adapt to your needs and interests
    * We did an open-source chip design course as a special course before
 * Will have rough edges
 * I am excited to see you building your own chips

## Introduction Round

 * Who are we?
   - Ole, Luca, and Martin
 * Who are you?
   - Why this course?
   - What is your background?

## Course Overview

 * Some initial lectures, including labs
 * Guest lectures
 * Project work
   - Pick a topic and work in groups
   - Design and tapeout a chip
     - By combining projects
     - Chip design is a large team effort
   - Use the Tiny Tapeout platform (and/or efabless)
   - Write a (short) report

## Moore's Law: the Exponential Growth

 * The number of transistors on a chip doubles every 2 years
 * Predicted by Gordon Moore in 1965 (Intel co-founder)
   * Still holds, but not for free
   * Transistors are getting smaller
   * Power density is increasing
   * The 7 nm technology node is common now
     - x nm was originally the gate length, but not anymore
   * When is the end of Moore's Law?
 * [Moor's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law)

## Dennard Scaling

 * Transistor size shrinks
   * Voltage scales down
   * Current scales down
   * Power density stays constant
 * Power stays proportional with area
 * No more Dennard scaling
   * Leakage current increases with smaller transistors

## Trends in Chip Design

 * Processors performance gains are slowing down
 * More specialized cores (e.g, AI accelerators)
 * More digital/ASIC designes needed
 * We need 20+ new chip designers per year in Denmark/Copenhagen
 * Bright future for you!

## Open Source Chip Design

 * Open source tools (OpenLane)
 * Open source PDK (SkyWater130)
 * Open source IP (e.g., RISC-V core Wildcat)
 * Open source chip framework (Caravell from efabless)
 * Open source teaching material (this course)

## Tools

 * Chisel
 * Verilog/Verilator
 * Yosys
 * OpenRoad and OpenLane
 * SkyWater PDK

## Chip Design Workflow

1. **Specification**: Define the chip's purpose and requirements  
2. **Architecture Design**: High-level design of the system
3. **RTL Design**: Register Transfer Level design using HDLs (e.g., Verilog, VHDL)
4. **Verification (Testing)**: Ensure the design meets specifications

## Chip Design Workflow cont.

5. **Synthesis**: Convert RTL to gate-level netlist
6. **Physical Design**: Floorplanning, placement, routing
7. **Fabrication**: Manufacturing the chip in a foundry
8. **Testing**: Post-production validation
9. **Bring-up**: First test of the chip
10. **Sell**: Profit!

## Key Components of a Chip
- **Transistors**: Building blocks of chips
- **Logic Gates**: AND, OR, NOT, etc.  
- **Flip-Flops**: Memory elements
- **Interconnects**: Wires connecting components  
- **Memory**: RAM, ROM  
- **I/O Pads**: Interface with external devices 


## Hardware Description Languages (HDLs)
- **Verilog**: Widely used for RTL design
  - With extenstion to SystemVerilog
  - We will introduce Verilog in this course
- **VHDL**: Popular in Europe and for complex systems
  - Almost not supported by open-source tools
- **Chisel**: Our Favorite! 
  - Scala-based HDL
  - You learned it in DE2

## OpenLane

 * OpenLane is an open-source digital ASIC flow
 * RTL to GDSII flow
   - GDSII is the final layout file for the chip
   - Sent to the foundry (short fab) for manufacturing 
 * Based on several open-source tools
 * Developed by efabless
 * Resuses OpenROAD and Yosys
 * We will explore OpenLane today!

## OpenRoad

 * Fully autonomous, no-human-in-the-loop flow
 * Collection of (open-source) tools for digital design
 * Sponsored by DARPA
 * Led by UC San Diego
 * Used by OpenLane

## Yosys: Open-Source Verilog Synthesis

  - Framework for Verilog RTL synthesis
  - Originally developed by Clifford Wolf as a BSc project at TU Wien
  - Converts RTL designs into gate-level netlists
  - Supports Verilog-2005 and (some) SystemVerilog
  - Includes optimization and formal verification
  - ASIC and FPGA synthesis
  - Educational and research projects
  - Part of the OpenROAD project

## Getting Started with Yosys
- **Installation**:  
  - Linux: `sudo apt-get install yosys`  
  - macOS: `brew install yosys`  

- **Basic Commands**:  
  ```bash
  read_verilog design.v       # Read Verilog file
  synth -top top_module       # Synthesize design
  write_verilog output.v      # Save netlist
  ```


## SkyWater PDK and Google

 * SkyWater PDK is an open-source PDK
 * The SkyWater fab was originally a Cypress fab
 * Google was pushing to open-source the PDK
 * Google sponsored MPW runs
   - We tried to get a chip produced, but failed :-(
   - Sponsoring is over
 * One MPW run is around $ 10.000 per tile
   - We might have money for MPW runs :-)  

## What is a PDK?

   * PDK: Process Design Kit
   * Contains the information for a specific technology node
       - Transistor models
       - Design rules
       - Metal layers
       - Via structures
       - ...
   * The PDK is provided by the fab
   * Needed to produce a GDSII file

## OpenLane2 Demo

 * Start nix with `nix-shell`
 * cd to wildcat
 * Show wildcat.json
 * Generate Verilog (`make hw-fmax`)
 * Run OpenLane and show results (see Makefile)
 * Explore in IntelliJ (or VSC)

## How are Chips Produced?

 * In a fab (short for fabrication plant)
 * Very expensive! (fab and masks)
   * MPW (Multi Project Wafer) is a way to share the cost
 * Details in VLSI course   
 * Watch [Matt Venn at IHP](https://youtu.be/aBDJQ9NYTEU?si=G19gW0zrbZuDSOp4)

## Tiny Tapeout

 * [Tiny Tapeout](https://tinytapeout.com/)
 * A simple flow for a simple chip
 * Uses one MPW tile from efabless
 * Cut into 512 mini tiles
   - 160 x 100 um tiles
 * Full flow in the cloud (GitHub Actions)
 * Cheap tile: 50 USD
 * We (Edu4Chip) sponsor one tile per project

## Tiny Tapout Workshop
 
 * Matt Venn runs a Tiny Tapeout workshop at DTU
 * Saturday 15th of January
 * From zero to a chip in 4 hours
 * [Tiny Tapeout Workshop](https://edu4chip.github.io/ttw2025DTU.html)

## Using Chisel

 * Who does not know Chisel?
 * Easy to learn in self study
   - Use the [Chisel book](https://www.imm.dtu.dk/~masca/chisel-book.html)
   - Do the [Chisel lab](https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-lab)
