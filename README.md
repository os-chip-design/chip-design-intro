*Students are expected to contribute to the course actively and help improve the material for the future version of the course.*

## Practicalities

The course runs on **Wednesdays from 13:00 to 17:00** in **Building 308 - Room 017**. 

Each weekly session consist of a lecture and laboratory work. Some session will be fully dedicated to laboratory work (especially at the end of the course when you are expected to work on your project).

The course has two teachers:
 * [Martin Schoeberl](https://www.imm.dtu.dk/~masca/)
 * [Luca Pezzarossa](https://www2.compute.dtu.dk/~lpez/)

You are very welcome to seek for help by approaching the teachers during the letctures and laboratory sessions, or via mail, or our Discord channel.
Also, feedback about the course is much appreciated.

## Tools

Install the OpenLane2 tools locally or use the server `chipdesign1.compute.dtu.dk`. The tools are currently usable on Linux and MacOS (even native with Mac Silicon). For Windows use WSL2 to have a Linux environment. There is no official support for Windows available. See [Lab 1](lab_01.md) for installation instructions.

## Course Aim

This course is an introduction to the design of digital integrated circuits. It covers the basics of digital circuits, the tools used, and the process of designing a chip. The course is based open-source tools and open-source PDKs. The course also gives the possibility for student projects to be taped out on Tiny Tapeout.

## Project: DTU-SoC-2025

The course project is focused on designing and implementing a **System-on-Chip (SoC)** using open-source tools. The goal is to collaboratively develop a working SoC that includes a **CPU, memory, peripherals, and essential interfaces**.

The project is hosted at [DTU-SoC-2025](https://github.com/os-chip-design/dtu-soc-2025).

### Group forming

The project should be carried out in **groups of 3 people** (groups of 2 are also possible but less preferred). You are free to select your group members. **Groups should be registered as soon as formed in the DTU-Learn group forming facility.** If you experience difficulties forming a group, please contact the teacher.

When forming a new group, please make sure that you align expectations between the members. To achieve this, we recommend having a discussion about each member’s availability, work habits, and goals for the course to ensure a smooth and collaborative experience.

### Project scope

Each student group will contribute to a part of the SoC. You can choose from the following components:

- **Cache system** for Wildcat
- **Memory controller** (handling SPI-based flash, RAM access, memory-mapped peripherals)
- **Peripherals:**
  - VGA character display
  - Keyboard interface
  - Serial port (UART)
  - GPIO and timer
  - Special IOs (PWM and others)
- **SPI interface** (with optional quad-mode support)
- **Continuous integration** (managing continuous verification after design changes)
- **Verification** (creating testbenches, simulations, and FPGA testing)
- **Physical design tools** (OpenLane2 workflow, synthesis, placement, routing, signoff)
- **Caravel** integration (integrating the design with the Caravel framework)

See Lecture 4 for more details.

### Weekly Coordination

To ensure smooth progress, we will coordinate weekly during the lab sessions. These sessions will be used to:

- Discuss progress and challenges faced by each group
- Provide feedback and guidance on design, implementation, and verification
- Address any issues related to tools and integration
- Keep track of milestones and ensure alignment with the tapeout schedule
- Work on the project

### Report

You are expected to hand-in a **report** describing your desing and your work. The report should be formatted as IEEE paper (IEEEtran template) and not be longer than 4 pages.
In the following, you can find the expected content of the report (not all entries may apply to your project):
  - *Title*
  - *Group number*
  - *Names and student IDs of the group members*
  - *Contributions:* Clearly state what each team member contributed to the project. This section is crucial for evaluating individual contributions and ensuring fair grading.
  - *Introduction*: Introduce your chosen design, outlining its purpose, objectives, and specifications.
  - *Design*: Summarize the key aspects of your design, including its functionality and features. Provide a detailed block diagram to illustrate the overall architecture. Explain how the design fits into the larger system.
  - *Implementation*:
    - Describe how you implemented your design using Verilog, Chisel, or both.
    - Highlight specific steps in the chip design process and explain how open-source tools were used.
    - Include details on performance, and area and any challenges encountered during the implementation.
    - Explain the testing methodology, including simulation results.
    - Describe how you verified the design.
    - Include results from DRC (Design Rule Check), timing analysis, etc. to demonstrate the design's readiness for tapeout.
    - Tapeout preparation: Summarize the final steps taken to prepare the design for tapeout, (integration with the Caravel framework and/or and ensuring compliance with Tiny Tapeout requirements). 
  - *Link/explanantion where to find your code* Explain where your code is located in your repository. Possibly link to a **README file** that includes all needed technical instructions.

The deadline for the hand-in is the **4th of May 2025** at **23:59**.
